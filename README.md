# Dollar General - Add All Coupons

## Introduction

This is a Chrome extension that adds an "Add All Coupons" button to the Dollar
General [Digital Coupons Gallery](https://dg.coupons.com/coupons/). The
Javascript action on this button will click on all the coupons in one shot,
adding all of them to "My Coupons".

## Installation

git clone this repository to your local disk or download the zip file and extract.

Go to the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions). You'll need to enable
developer mode in order to load an unpacked extension.

Click on "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the folder in which you
cloned or extracted the source files. Select this folder to load the extension.

## Usage

Once you've installed and enabled this extension, go to the Dollar General
Digital Coupons Gallery and find the "Add All Coupons" button just above the
first row of coupons. Click on it and it'll add all the coupons to "My
Coupons".
